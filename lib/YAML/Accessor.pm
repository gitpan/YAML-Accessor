=head1 NAME

YAML::Accessor

=head1 ABSTRACT

Syntactic sugar for YAML::XS using Class::Accessor with sub-accessors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package YConfig;
  use base qw{ YAML::Accessor };
  
  # Load by filename
  my $yc = YConfig->new(
    file => 'config.yml',  # Can be a filehandle.
    readonly   => 1,       # This is a default. Can be 1 (true).
    damian     => 1,       # See below. Can be 0 (false).

    # Implemented, but probably buggy and not tested.
    autocommit => 0,       # This is a default. Can be 1 (true).
  )
  or die "failed to load 'config.yml' [$!]";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<YAML::Accessor> aims to create a "gettr/settr" interface for YAML
objects/files and allow the user to both manipulate their structure
and to read and write from the (specified) file(s).

It doesn't use the simple C<YAML::XS> call C<LoadFile> and this may
seem unituitive for users of YAML::XS. The point is not to reinvent
L<YAML::XS>, but rather to create intuitive, easily-constructed objects
with proper accessor/mutator methods.

There are lots of things one could do with this; the obvious use case
is a config file.

=head1 PARAMETERS

C<file> is not optional. It's got to be a filehandle or a scalar that
(hopefully) refers to a file you can read. If not, C<new()> barfs and
properly sets C<$!> for you.

C<autocommit> is optional. If you set this to true, your file will be
written to each time a mutator is called.

C<readonly> is optional. It defaults to true. This means you get no
mutators ("settrs") and you won't munge your file accidentally. If you
set C<readonly> and C<autocommit> both to true, C<new> explodes and you
deserve what you get. But you still get C<$!>.

C<damian> refers to the L<Class::Accessor> method "follow_best_practice",
which is defined in Damian Conway's book on "Perl Best Practices" on ORA.
If you set this to true, your methods will be
  
  $obj->get_foo();     # gets the value of foo
  $obj->set_foo(100);  # sets foo to 100 

If you don't like this, set damian to false (that is, 0 or undef or ''),
and your methods will be:
  
  $foo = $obj->foo();  # returns value of foo
  $obj->foo(100);      # sets foo to 100

C<damian> defaults to true.

=head1 METHODS

C<get_foo()> accessors will return whatever the value of C<foo> is (note
use of "Damianized" accessor here). In the event there's a list of things,
you need to read the code to the C<get()> method in this module.

C<set_foo()> mutators will set the value of whatever field is specified
(in this case, "foo" -- noting again the "Damianized" mutator). Mutators
return one of two things. If you've set C<autocommit> to true, the mutator
will return the value of the latest attempt to "commit" (write) your file.
In the event you have not turned on C<autocommit> during the constructor,
the mutator will simply return the value(s) supplied. For more detail,
have a look at the code. But really, it's not too complicated.

=head1 SUB-ACCESSORS

When calling an accessor method, the object will try to determine whether
the value you are requesting is itself an accessor (or rather, should be
made an accessor). Therefore you may use a construct such as:

  $obj->get_foo()->get_bar();

and it should Just Work. Note that this only works for hash values. If you
request an accessor that has an array or scalar (or anything else), you'll
simply get what you asked for.

Note that this is not standard L<Class::Accessor> behavior. The reason for
this is that YAML allows us to have deeply-nested structures, and having to
refer to their hash keys after a single layer of accessors, like such:

  $obj->get_foo()->{bar};

is tedious and misses the point of this package.

=head1 BUGS

The implementation actually doesn't allow this module to internally use 
L<Class::Accessor> and instead overrides its C<get()> and C<set()> functions
to refer to your shiny YAML object. That's kind of inconsistent, but you
wanted YAML, not an object that referred to YAML. If you can come up with
a way to fix it, awesome. This way is simpler.

Also, it looks like doing something like

  use base qw{ Class::Accessor };
  use base qw{ YAML::Accessor  };

is fraught with peril. Don't do that.

While not exactly a bug, this package uses L<YAML::XS> instead of L<YAML>
in the interest of speed and ingy's preference.
